In September 2023, we sought to enter this space with something truly revolutionary, unveiling a product 5 years in the making at [Playgrounds in Motion](https://weareplaygrounds.nl/in-motion-festival/) in London. We needed to differentiate Dreams not just through its features, but through a compelling narrative that would resonate with both professional animators and newcomers to the medium, marking a historic milestone for accessible animation in the Apple ecosystem.",
