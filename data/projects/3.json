We chose to go against the grain and make a bold statement about our commitment to human creativity. We wanted to reassure our community that Procreate will always be a tool for human expression, nothing more.",
          "On August 19th, we released a statement on X. James Cuda, Procreate's CEO, made a bold statement about our commitment to human creativity and promised that we would never ship generative AI in our products or train on our users' work. The response was overwhelming. Our post received over 22k reposts, 80k likes, 2k comments, 28k reposts, and 7k bookmarks."

          "When we let AI generate our art, we rob ourselves of the essential skills that can only come through observation, practice, and dedication. The value of creative pursuit lies in the journey itselfâ€“the countless hours spent understanding light and shadow, form and perspective, and the complexities of the human form; a strenuous process of wrestling just to get better that no LLM can replace."
