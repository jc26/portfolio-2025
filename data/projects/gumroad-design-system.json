So it was well-overdue that in 2024, we undertook the big task of revamping and standardizing our design system across Figma and in code. By leveraging Figma's latest component and variable features, we aligned our design components with their Storybook counterparts to reduce QA overhead and prioritize what's most important: shipping features."

          "2. Establishing a shared language between designers and developers to minimize miscommunication. Some of the words we were using were only intuitive for either designer or developer, not both. As a remote-first ([not anymore](https://x.com/shl/status/1851590388898759037)) company, using clear, unambiguous terminology that both designers and developers could easily understand was crucial for reducing QA cycles and shipping features faster."

The goal was perfect parity between design and code—ensuring designers and developers work with identical variables. It was also an exercise in restraint: I kept the system intentionally lean to make it more maintainable and scalable, avoiding an overly complex variable structure that becomes unwieldy over time."

By making our design system public, we're continuing this tradition. Where we excel, we can help others learn. Where we fall short, the community can help us improve. This collaborative approach makes our products better and strengthens the entire ecosystem that many creators rely on for income."

Our mission has always been to minimize barriers for creators to earn their first dollar online - it's that simple. Gumroad has already removed many traditional hurdles of selling online, giving creators a scalable foundation for storefronts. As we foster an open community around our platform, we can work together to make the product even better for creators everywhere."
