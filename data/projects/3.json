          "In a world increasingly dominated by AI-generative tools, Procreate needed to make a bold statement. Generative AI has no place in the journey of creative self-mastery. The goal of learning to paint and draw is to truly see the world around us, to understand the complexities of the human form, and to develop our own artistic voice.",
          "When we let AI generate our art, we rob ourselves of the essential skills that can only come through observation, practice, and dedication. The value of creative pursuit lies in the journey itself - the countless hours spent understanding light and shadow, form and perspective, the process of wrestling and growing that no LLM can replace."
