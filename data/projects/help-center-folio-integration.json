          "Procreate's community platform, Folio, was a relic from the company's early days, burdened with technical and brand debt. Analysis showed **99% of users visited only for Discussions** (feature requests, Q&A, resource sharing), while the image-sharing component had minimal ROI and high upkeep costs, mostly for moderation.",
          "The site's usability had grown stale, not reflecting Procreate's quality standards. It had become a place where we'd sometimes scroll `/recent` just to share funny spam posts â€“ it was hurting the brand. For a company valuing 'Care', Folio didn't show we genuinely invested in addressing user issues.",
          "Simultaneously, our main support platform, Help Center, was read-only. Our CEO James Cuda decided that the only way forward that made sense was to **sunset Folio and migrate Discussions** to a redesigned Help Center, improving the overall help experience and reducing debt."

          "**Prevent duplicates proactively:** Duplicate posts should ideally be avoided *before* creation, not just merged after the fact.",
          "**Simplify navigation:** Our existing tags, categories, and sub-pages were confusing. It wasn't clear where users should post their specific question or suggestion.",
          "**Resolve the identity crisis:** Folio was caught between being a place for self-expression and product support. We needed to **pick one focus (product discussions)**, which meant streamlining features like removing profile cover images, guided by the question: 'Do we *really* need it?'"

          "**A cohesive, natural user flow:** There was almost no uniting user flow in the old Folio. I believed if I solved that issue, the visual solutions would naturally follow. By cutting down so much of what we had, my vision was that users would naturally flow from Questions to Resources to Suggestions, a flow that could mirror their experience in-app.",
          "**Suggestions & Roadmap:** This needed careful handling due to past unmet expectations. Users were furiously knocking on our doors. I designed the new Suggestions board to look like discussion threads but **removed misleading tags** like 'Planned' or 'Not Planned'. The goal was honest acknowledgment without over-promising, managing the delicate balance between product promises and user expectations.",
          "**Post Creation Flow:** To tackle duplicates, the new flow integrated search upfront, functioning like a non-intrusive guide towards existing relevant discussions.",
          "**Thread Digestion:** Explored ways to make digesting threads with 1000+ comments feasible (specific UI solutions omitted)."
